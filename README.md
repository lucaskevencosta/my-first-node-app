# my-first-node-app
It's a simple application that register a product and return the list of products.

Basicly this application is a end point that receive a simple json object:

product{
  description ,
  price
}

This product is saved in a database, and then, de application responds the request with the list of products saved in database.

To do the end point was used express. For the database was used SQLite 3 and sequelize.

I'm a student of english, so if my text have some mistake, please tell me.
